In our simulation, we explored twenty user scenarios with different ground locations. In addition, due to the randomness of handover time, we have carried out many experiments to find the mean value. There may be a slight gap between the results of a single experiment or different times of experiments and ours. However, overall, the experimental results fully prove the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.
