In our simulation, we explored twenty user scenarios with different ground locations. In addition, due to the randomness of handover time, we have carried out many experiments to find the mean value. There may be a slight gap between the results of a single experiment or different times of experiments and ours. However, overall, the experimental results fully prove the effectiveness of our proposed strategy. Our code may not be perfect, so when you are confused about some parts of the code, you can contact us at any time, and we will give you a detailed reply, which has made us progress together.
